# TeachingActivitiesOfStudent

This is web-application for Teaching activities of students. Main goal is to ensure easier communication between professor and student on a project-oriented subject. During development, teacher requirements to have an easy insight into the progress of a student on a particular subject were taken into consideration. Functional demands such as logging into system, manipulation of user privileges and roles, browsing and editing subjects, and managing activities and comments were determined. The application is implemented using an object-oriented paradigm, Java programming language, Spring Framework, and MySQL database management system. In addition to the theoretical part of the architecture of the system and the technology used, the work also consists of a detailed description of the user interface and instruction manual.
